Portfolio Website with GSAP
This is a portfolio website built using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) framework for animations.

Getting Started
To run the website locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the code.

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor.

Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine.

Install GSAP by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm install gsap
Launch the website by opening the index.html file in a web browser or using a local server.

If animations do not work:

Make sure GSAP is installed correctly by checking for any errors in the console.
If animations still don't work, manually download GSAP from the official GSAP website and include it in the project folder. Link the GSAP library in the HTML file.
Troubleshooting
As GSAP might be new technology for some users, here are some common issues you might encounter:

Compatibility issues with certain browsers. Ensure you are using a modern web browser that supports GSAP.
Inconsistencies in animation behavior due to different browser versions.
Check for console errors related to missing or incorrect GSAP implementations.
Verify that the GSAP library path is correctly referenced in the HTML file.
